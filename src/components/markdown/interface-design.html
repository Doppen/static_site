<p>Humanities data is often complex and hard to interpret. Our team focuses on making this data accessible and understandable. The output of the KNAW Humanties Cluster must be accessible to many people, not just to researchers. We create tools that places data in the right context so that they are better understood and easy to use. And we strive to make our interfaces inclusive, device-agnostic and long-lasting so that these can be accessible long into the future. The team specialises in user research, web usability, interface design, web publication, data visualisation and project branding.</p>
